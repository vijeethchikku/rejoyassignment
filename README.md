# rejoyassignment5

The goal of this project is to use Python and related modules to create a neural network. In order to assess the neural network's efficacy and performance, it must be designed, trained, and tested on a specific dataset. Additionally, the study offers insights on deployment techniques and evaluation methods for machine learning models.

## Getting Started

You can set up the project on your local computer for testing and development with the help of these instructions. For information on executing the project in a production setting, see deployment.

### Prerequisites

How to install software and what you need to do so:

The anaconda


Installing the necessary dependencies:
Installing Numpy Pandas TensorFlow with pip The scikit-learn matplotlib


### Installing

https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/docs/problem_solving/01-Orientation/01.03-Installing-Anaconda-on-Windows.html

End the setup process by confirming that all tests pass successfully.

## Running the tests

Describe how to execute this system's automated tests.

### Break down into end-to-end tests

The entire process, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, is validated by these tests.

test_script.py in Python


This script checks for preprocessing and data loading.
Initialization and training of the model.
Metric computations and evaluation.

### And coding style tests

These tests ensure adherence to Python coding standards and conventions.

flake8 <project_directory>


This command checks for PEP 8 compliance and suggests fixes for coding style issues.

## Deployment

To deploy the model on a live system:

1. Train the model and save it:
python train.py --save_model


2. Use a web framework like Flask or FastAPI to serve the model:
python app.py


3. Access the model's API endpoint via the browser or HTTP clients like Postman.
